Good job! Just a few comments about Q3 though!

The best way to count rows in HBase table is to use Apache Phoenix and fire a query for counting rows. This will be very fast as it uses the new Coprocessors feature of HBase.
Or you can use "count" command (as you did) or "RowCounter" which fires MR job directly. This'll be slow compared to using Coprocessors!

Q2: You have uploaded the wrong screenshot.

 

RowCounter script:

hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.RowCounter 'user'
